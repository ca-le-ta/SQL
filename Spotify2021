 For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. Which artists had more than one song appear in the op 50 songs of 2021?
SELECT artist_name, count(*) as "song_count" FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
    HAVING song_count >1;

#2. How many minutes of music are in the songs by Doja Cat?
SELECT sum((duration_ms/1000)/60) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    WHERE artist_name = "Doja Cat";

#3. Which song has the highest danceability? 
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY danceability DESC
    LIMIT 1;

#4. How many songs from this list contain a featured artist? 
SELECT count(*) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    WHERE track_name LIKE '%feat%';
